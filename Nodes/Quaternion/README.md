# Quaternion

This is a set of custom nodes for use with Shader Graph that allow you to do quaternion calculations inside the graph.

- Quaternion Inverse
- Quaternion From Euler
- Quaternion From Angle Axis
- Quaternion To Angle Axis
- Quaternion From To Rotation
- Quaternion Multiply
- Quaternion Rotate Vector
- Quaternion Slerp

Quaternions are inputted and outputted as Vector4 values. All angles are in degrees.

To use simply add the .cs file to your project then inside Shader Graph click Create Node > Math > Quaternion and use one of the nodes.
